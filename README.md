Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data

### About me
Hi, I am a product designer, and I believe my curiosity is what fuels innovation and leads me to new connections and discoveries. I am a 2nd year Master of Design student in the School of Design.
After graduating from Pratt Institute with a Bachelor's in industrial design, I worked at iOttie Inc designing consumer electronics and at Fossil Group designing smartwatches and traditional watches for Michael Kors. Most recently, I've interned at BCG as an experience designer. 
Outside of design, i enjoy having nerdy discussions about watches and playing tennis!

### What I hope to learn
I want to continue learning data visualization methodologies and techniques. Last year, I was briefly exposed to data visualization, and it was definitely an area of discipline I was attracted to. Over my summer internship, the project I was working on involved designing a dashboard, and having an in-depth knowledge of this topic could have helped me drastically. I understand the importance of clear communication and data visualization is something I want to continue learning and improving on.
