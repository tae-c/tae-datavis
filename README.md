Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data

### About me
Hi, I am a product designer, and I believe my curiosity is what fuels innovation and leads me to new connections and discoveries. I am a 2nd year Master of Design student in the School of Design.
After graduating from Pratt Institute with a Bachelor's in industrial design, I worked at iOttie Inc designing consumer electronics and at Fossil Group designing smartwatches and traditional watches for Michael Kors. Most recently, I've interned at BCG as an experience designer. 
Outside of design, i enjoy having nerdy discussions about watches and playing tennis!

### What I hope to learn
I want to continue learning data visualization methodologies and techniques. Last year, I was briefly exposed to data visualization, and it was definitely an area of discipline I was attracted to. Over my summer internship, the project I was working on involved designing a dashboard, and having an in-depth knowledge of this topic could have helped me drastically. I understand the importance of clear communication and data visualization is something I want to continue learning and improving on.

### Portfolio
Below are assignments to _Telling Stories with Data_ course, but feel free to check out my design portfolio [here]

### Assignment:Visualizing goverment debt
Part 1

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/7aXS" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/7aXS" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2019</a></iframe>

Part 2

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/14928192"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Part 3

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-bar-chart-race" data-src="visualisation/14928571"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

I wanted to show a race of these countries over the course of 1995 to 2017. The chart is only showing the top 10 countries with the highest debt-to-gdp ratio. I couldn't figure out a way to directly import the data into the preset template. So I only showed 15 countries and did some manual data entry. The 15 countries shown are Austrailia, AUstria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Rep, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, and Japan
