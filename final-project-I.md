### Data I will be using

It was difficult to find datasets on topics relating to workplace stress, workplace satisfaction, burnout, employee happiness, and etc. Since many companies do not make those datasets public, the ones I could get my hands on were made up datasets on Kaggle that represent example HR metrics on employee attrition. I did not want to use any made up datasets, so I will be leveraging survey results from Buffer for my project. 

### Project outline

I want for this project to serve as an aid for my design thesis. Currently in my second year of a Master's program at the school of design, I am dedicating this academic year to conducting a design research and writing a thesis. The theme of my thesis, which is still WIP, delves into the exploration of how design can be a factor in mitigating workplace stress, enhancing self-determined motivation, and preventing burnout, by helping coworkers build high-quality relationships with one another. Subsequently, I have been on the lookout for datasets concerning employee stress, burnout, workplace satisfaction, and related elements. My search led me to an extensive survey by Buffer titled "State of Remote Work 2023". It appears they conduct this substantial survey annually with employees globally and make the findings public. The results show a diverse array of questions, presenting an abundance of statistics. Although each set of data is valuable on their own, my intention is to selectively extract specific results to craft a narrative around workplace satisfaction through a scrollable story on Shorthand. This could serve as an aid for visualizing the problem space in my thesis. Given that Buffer releases the "State of Remote Work" annually, I will also be able to access past data, allowing me to visualize any trends I wish to highlight as needed.

This is the rough draft of how I want to tell my story.

1. Acknowledging that remote/hybrid work is here to stay, but recognizing the need to be cautious. With survey results showing that 98% want to work in some remote capacity for the rest of their careers, it's certainly here to stay. I want to start the story with a simple line pie chart visualizing the percentages of remote workers who work remotely full-time, part-time (hybrid) or on occasion.

2. Diving into the struggles of working remotely. There are many factors reported by the participants on the struggles of working remotely, however, I will only highlight a few. To stay within my narrative, I want to highlight "loneliness", "lack of motivation", "difficult to focus", and "staying home too much & no reason to leave" With these data, I want to have these in large texts representing size to the percentage, similar to my sketch below.

3. Highlighting that people value work-life balance. When working remotely, 44% say they work more than they used to before and 1/5 people feel more burned out compared to 2022.

4. Showcasing another big struggle of working remotely is that people feel it's difficult to experience career growth. 51% of participants say growth is more difficult remotely due to the lack of physical visibility. They fear that not having physical presence in the office limits them from new opportunities. Also 39% say they do not know how to promote their success in a remote work setting.

5. Finally, after highlighting all of these trends in remote working, I want to open a space for my design intervention. As I am in the beginning phase of my thesis, I do not know yet what the form will take for my proposed design intervention. However, I do know that it will aim to improving how coworkers build relationships with one another.

As for designing how the story is told, I want simple animated infographics similar to [this]. I'm curious if Shorthand is able to play animated videos on scroll similar to how Apple showcases products on their website (playing videos and revealing content as you scroll).
