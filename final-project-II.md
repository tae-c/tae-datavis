Here is a more flushed out flow of my final project with wireframes included and with the 3 phases identified (setup, conflict, resolution).

PS, I wanted this project to go hand-in-hand with my thesis that I am exploring this academic year in the School of Design. As for being in the beginning phase of my thesis, I want this project to help build the story of the problem space that I am exploring: burnouts in the workplace. 

## Storyboards with wireframes

### Setup

The project (which will be delivered through Shorthand) will start off by highlighting the fact that many people still work remotely at least part time.

 According to a study done by the U.S. Census Bureau, roughly 3 out of 10 workers in the US work remotely at least part time in 2023. This may not seem like a lot, but once you gain a different perspective on this, it appears much larger.

 When looking a little bit deeper into the US workforce, it tells a different story in regards to remote working. Since remote work is more accessible to "white collar" jobs, I looked at how much of the workforce in white collar jobs are remotely working. Roughly 7 out of 10 "white collar" workers in the US work remotely at least part time, which is around 46 million people in the US. This is not a small subset of the workforce by any means.

 When looking at common struggles that remote workers face in 2023 (from a large survey conducted by Buffer), we can see that these 5 are the main struggles of the remote workforce.

Throughout the last 4 years of the same survey results, we can see that some of these problems have subsided over time, but we can see that...

...these 3 problems have more or less increased or stayed towards the top of the results year over year. The big issue that I want to highlight here is that these 3 factors, althought not limited to these, are main causes that lead modern day employees into burnouts.

### Conflict

 ![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/143672477/271869441-6c187ecf-a2c9-41ac-8d67-44294e209e06.jpg)
 This is where I introduce the dangers of workplace burn out. In fact, it was recognized by the WHO in the 11th revision of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as an "occupational phenomenon." I want to raise awareness here as I enter the "conflict" stage.

 ![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/143672477/271869453-279c3158-6633-4a70-9c70-6b2211b9369c.jpg)
 According to a study done by Gallup with over 5000 employees, 23% of US workers feel burntout often or always and 44% feel it sometimes.

 That's nearly 2/3 of the participants indicating a level of significant stress that they experience while working.

### Resolution

 I want to take time to introduce a study done by Fernet that looks into the relationship between workpalce burnout and the quality of relationships that employees have among each other. The results show that having high-quality relationships with other emplyoees not only improve self determined motivation, but it also reduce burnout over time and can be a great predictor of workplace burnout.

 The story will conclude here as I introduce the area for the potential solution to this wicked problem. For my School of Design thesis, I want to pursue exploring how design can be a benefit in this exact area. Through design, I want to improve motivation among employees, build high quality relationships with one another in this hybrid working climate, and ultimately prevent burnouts from happening in the workplace. 

## User Interview Protocol

### Target Audience I hope to reach with my story
 Generally anyone in the US workforce who work remotely at least part-time during the week

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
 Since my target audience is a relatively large subset of people it was not difficult to recruit individuals to interview. I deemed that it was valid to be a participant of my interview as long as the person has worked in a corporate setting before.

### Interview Script
 
 #### Introduction
 "Today, we're going to see a story narrative with visuals, and your feedback will be invaluable in refining the narrative and visuals for our audience. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers. We're interested in your genuine thoughts and feelings."

#### Setting context
"Before we start, I want to explain at a high level what the visual narrative is about, and who I am. I am a Master’s student in the School of Design, and I am writing a research thesis this year on how design might help coworkers build high-quality relationships so that employee motivation is improved and burnouts are reduced over time."
"This narrative will highlight the status of remote work in 2023, go over common struggles that people have in remote working, escalate the significance of workplace stress and burnouts in the modern day, and suggest a potential solution method for the problem space. Are we ready to begin?"

#### Presenting the story
"Now I will walk through the story narrative along with its visuals. Please pay close attention and when it’s over, we can discuss your thoughts and impressions." _Walk through the story narrative_

#### Follow-up questions
"What are some of your immediate reactions to the story and the visuals you’ve seen?"
"Were there any parts of the story or visuals that were confusing or unclear to you?"
"Did the visuals complement the narrative? Why or why not?"
"Was there a particular visual or segment that stood out, either positively or negatively?"
"Are there any additional visuals or narrative elements you'd want to see included?"
"Any other final thoughts?"
